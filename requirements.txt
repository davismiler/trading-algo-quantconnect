# Core dependencies
# Note: Python 3.14 compatibility - some packages may need latest versions
numpy>=1.26.0
pandas>=2.2.0
matplotlib>=3.8.0
tabulate>=0.9.0

# Machine Learning
# IMPORTANT: TensorFlow does not yet support Python 3.14 (as of 2024)
# TensorFlow currently supports Python 3.9-3.12
# 
# Solutions:
# 1. Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (recommended for best compatibility)
# 2. For QuantConnect: TensorFlow is provided by the platform, no local install needed
# 3. For local development: Use Python 3.11/3.12 or wait for TensorFlow 3.14 support
#
# If using Python 3.11 or 3.12, uncomment the following:
# tensorflow>=2.16.0
# keras>=2.16.0
#
# For QuantConnect platform: TensorFlow/Keras are pre-installed
# No local installation required for algorithm deployment

# Reinforcement Learning
torch>=2.4.0
gym>=0.26.0  # Latest version is 0.26.2 (no 0.28.0 available)

# API and Environment
requests>=2.32.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.1

# QuantConnect LEAN (installed via QuantConnect platform)
# AlgorithmImports is provided by QuantConnect platform

# Python Version Compatibility Notes:
# - Python 3.14: TensorFlow not yet supported (use Python 3.11 or 3.12)
# - Python 3.11/3.12: Full compatibility with all packages
# - Python 3.9/3.10: Should work but may need older package versions
#
# For QuantConnect Development:
# - TensorFlow/Keras are provided by QuantConnect platform
# - Local installation only needed for research.ipynb development
# - Consider using Python 3.11/3.12 for local research environment
#
# Installation Instructions:
# 1. If using Python 3.14: Install packages individually, skip TensorFlow
# 2. If using Python 3.11/3.12: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. For QuantConnect: Upload code directly, no local TensorFlow needed
